	abstract = {An important piece of the capital structure puzzle has been missing, and it is not a contracting friction. It is recognition that managers do not have sufficient knowledge to optimize capital structure with any real precision. The literature critique in this paper i) identifies the conceptual sources of the main empirical failures of the leading models of capital structure and ii) shows how those failures can be repaired by taking into account imperfect managerial knowledge and several other factors. The analysis yields a compact set of principles for thinking about capital structure in an empirically supported way.},

	abstract = {We introduce a uniﬁed deep learning method that solves dynamic economic models by casting them into nonlinear regression equations. We derive such equations for three fundamental objects of economic dynamics – lifetime reward functions, Bellman equations and Euler equations. We estimate the decision functions on simulated data using a stochastic gradient descent method. We introduce an all-in-one integration operator that facilitates approximation of high-dimensional integrals. We use neural networks to perform model reduction and to handle multicollinearity. Our deep learning method is tractable in large-scale problems, e.g., Krusell and Smith (1998). We provide a TensorFlow code that accommodates a variety of applications.},

We structurally estimate dynamic ﬁrm ﬁnancing models embedding many ﬁnancial frictions, on panels of public ﬁrms and private ﬁrms. We focus on limited enforcement, moral hazard, and trade-off models and assess which models rationalize best observed corporate policies across various samples. Our tests, based on empirical policy function benchmarks, favor trade-off models for larger public ﬁrms, limited commitment models for smaller public ﬁrms, and moral hazard models for Private ﬁrms. Our estimates suggest signiﬁcant ﬁnancing constraints due to agency frictions and highlight the importance of identifying their sources for ﬁrm valuation.},

	abstract = {We review the last two decades of research in dynamic corporate ﬁnance, focusing on capital structure and the ﬁnancing of investment. We ﬁrst cover continuous time contingent claims models, starting with real options models, and working through static and dynamic capital structure models. We then move on to corporate ﬁnancing models based on discrete-time dynamic investment problems. We cover the basic model with no ﬁnancing, as well as more elaborate models that include features such as costly external ﬁnance, cash holding, and both safe and risky debt. For all the models, we oﬀer a minimalist, simpliﬁed presentation with a great deal of intuition. Throughout, we show how these models can answer questions concerning the eﬀects of ﬁnancial constraints on investment, the level of corporate leverage, the speed of adjustment of leverage to its target, and market timing, among others. Finally, we review and explain structural estimation of corporate ﬁnance models.},
