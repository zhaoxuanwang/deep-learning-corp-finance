# Deep Learning Applications in Structural Corporate Finance Models

This repository contains the implementation of deep learning methods for structural corporate finance models, based on the work of **Strebulaev (2012)** and **Maliar et al. (2021)**.

## Project Overview
This project is divided into several key components:
1. **Literature Survey:** Providing a brief review and discussion of the dynamic models in optimal investment and financing problems, and applying standard methods as solutions (e.g., discrete state value function iteration).
2. **Deep Learning Application:** Implementing the Maliar et al. (2021) method that uses deep learning to solve for the dynamic programming problems in corporate finance.
3. **Structural Estimation:** Implementing and comparing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) for model estimation.
4. **Extensions:** Bayesian estimation using MCMC, validation tests, and implementation in real-world datasets.

## Roadmap & Status
- [ ] **Part 1:** Python and TensorFlow implementation of the optimal investment problem and Maliar method (In Progress).
- [ ] **Part 2:** Structural estimation based on GMM, SMM, and effectiveness tests.
- [ ] **Extension 1:** Bayesian estimation using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with filtering.
- [ ] **Extension 2:** Empirical implementation of Cronqvist et al. (2024).
- [ ] **Extension 3:** Empirical implementation of Nikolov et al. (2021) with real-world datasets.

## Key Technical Components
